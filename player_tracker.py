"""
Player detection & projection module

Purpose
-------
Runs YOLO to detect players each frame, then projects each player’s bottom-center
point into bird’s-eye space for analytics and overlays.

What it does
------------
- detect_players(frame): YOLO inference → list of [x1, y1, x2, y2] boxes
- project_player_positions(boxes, H): bottom-center of each box → perspectiveTransform
- detect_and_project(frame, H): convenience returning (boxes, projected_points)

Inputs
------
- BGR frame (OpenCV), homography H (3×3)

Outputs
-------
- Image-space bounding boxes and bird’s-eye (x, y) points

Assumptions
-----------
- Bottom-center of bbox reasonably approximates foot location for court placement
- Homography H is valid when projection is requested
